This is the Ai github Saas Project where user give github Url as input and see commits that are done on that github repo and summarise the github repo commits.

Here, Main feature is to show all commits of the repo and give summary of the perticular commits that user want to know

Main logic : i take github repo url from user, take commits then this https://github.com/userName/repoName/commit/hashCode.diff url provide text which show what changes are made in the perticular commit and then output of this function is given to the aisummariseCommit function , in which i already set format for summary that use google gemini and then provide the summary.
